# Test Prove Your Worth - Python

Repository with the files necessary to solve the "Prove Your Worth" technical test.

Python files: `main.py` file contains all function calls and `util.py` contains all functions.

The metadata folder contains the headers that were inspected in each step and a file with logs of each process. **The `metadata/output.txt` file contains the answer to the test (a link to an image alluding to 'nice you did it')**

The `test_final_output.json` file is the final output (with a test URL) to check that everything was sent correctly.
